Preventing a DDOS attack
DDOS attacks are malicious system attacks that target network services, by attacking a specific or multiple service one can take down a whole server. DDOS attacks can target many aspects of a system Web traffic, end to ed connection, bandwidth flow. These attacks can be prevented by writing a script to tighten Firewall rules or monitoring the traffic flow, install tools that track network behavior, itâ€™s also important to have all the services the system provides up to date. My script scratched the surface on this topic and will improve them in time.
